A program to help easily transfer your pixel art from .png or .jpg form onto an SS13 canvas, 
because every second you spend in front of a canvas is another second you could be killed.

This program is meant to assist artists by letting them work in their preferred spriting program of choice,
then transfer their art after. It's not perfect but it gets the job done.


## How to Use
There are a few steps behind how to use this program, hopefully it's easy enough:

1) Upload a .png or .jpg file in the correct resolution, correlating with one of the available canvases in-game.
    - .png is recommended due to .jpg compression leading to massive color amounts.
2) In-game, grab a spray-can or palette in-hand. A palette is recommended as it doesn't require you to open a menu.
3) Click the "Set Location" button for the "Color-Picker" option. This is where the differences in palette/spray-can show up.
    - Spraycan: Open the spraycan's menu in-game, and set the position on the "Custom Color" button using the draggable pop-up window. DO NOT CLOSE THE SPRAYCAN MENU!
    - Palette: Select the position of the palette in your hand using the draggable pop-up window.
4) Open the Custom Color menu in-game (the one with the color triangle/wheel), and set the location of the hex-code input field using the draggable pop-up window.
5) Close the Custom Color menu in-game by clicking Confirm.
6) Now, open up the canvas' UI in-game
7) Under "Canvas Positions", press "Set Location" and resize the pop-up window so the canvas is in the center.
    - If you uploaded your image before this, the pop-up window will have a grid that matches the canvas you should be using, which makes it a little easier to line up.
8) Press start!
    - If you need the program to stop, press the stop key noted in the top of the window (default "k")
    - If you want to continue where you left off after stopping, press the Continue button!

The Stop button and Transfer Tickspeed can be adjusted using the Preferences window in the Tools menu.
In case you forget how to use this but don't want to come back to this page, there's an Instructions option in the Tools menu too!
