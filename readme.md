A program to help easily transfer your pixel art from .png or .jpg form onto an SS13 canvas, 
because every second you spend in front of a canvas is another second you could be killed.

This program is meant to assist artists by letting them work in their preferred spriting program of choice,
then transfer their art after. It's not perfect but it gets the job done.


## How to Use
There are a few steps behind how to use this program, hopefully it's easy enough:

1) Upload a .png or .jpg file in the correct resolution, correlating with one of the available canvases in-game.
    - .png is recommended due to .jpg compression leading to massive color amounts.
2) In-game, use a spraycan in-hand to open its menu. 
3) Click the Color-Picker button and hover your mouse over the button that opens the color-picker, then press the scan key (default "i")
4) Open the color-picker, and input the location for the Hex Input Field in the same way
5) Input the location for the confirmation button
6) Now, open up the canvas' UI
7) Input the position of the Top-Left pixel, trying to get in the center of it.
8) Input the position of the Top-Right pixel
9) Repeat for Bottom-Left pixel
10) Press start!
11) If you need the program to stop, press the stop key noted in the top of the window (default "k")
